# Linear-and-binary-searching-Lab1

Observation:
When tested against a smaller range of data, both performed well, no significant time was displayed in the console. But, when tested against 1000000, linear search took 0.0468950 sec to find the item at 999999th index but still no significant time was displayed in the console in case of Binary Search, which proves Binary Search performs faster than the Linear Search. Similarly, the type of data didnâ€™t the search result for linear search whereas the binary search performed successfully only with the sorted sample of data, which proves binary search is effective in sorted type of data only.
Result:	
The major limitation of binary search is that there is a need for the sorted array to perform the binary search operation. If the array is not sorted the output is either not correct or maybe after a long number of steps and according to the data structure, the output should come in a minimum number of steps. A binary search is typically faster than a sequential search but requires that the data is sorted. Binary search has logarithmic time complexity whereas, linear search has linear time complexity.
